<h2>History:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Murugan or Karthikeyan is the son of the Hindu god Shiva and Parvati . </li>
    <li>Lord Shiva released the forehead fire from his face and Lord Vayu, who carried it, threw Saravana into the river.</li>
    <li>Those fires grew into six children with Kartika women.</li>
    <li>According to Hindu scriptures, Murugan appeared as Arumuga when mother Parvati cradled her six children together.</li> 
    <li>He is considered to be the younger brother of Ganapati, the Lord of Ganas .</li> <br>

    <li> Muruga also had a wife named Deivanai, the daughter of Indra, and a girl named Valli, a Kuratthi girl.</li> <br>
    <img src ="murugan with wife.jpg" width="150" height="200"> <br>
    <li>Tamils are the most worshipers of him and thus he is also known as the Tamil God.</li>

    <li> The worship of Murugan, which was a separate religion called Kaumaram in ancient times , later merged with Hinduism.</il>   
<h2> Name reason:</h2> 
<li>The word "Murugu" means beauty, youth. </li>
<li>So Murugan means handsome. As the vowel u along with the mellina, medial and vallina consonants together form Muruku (m+u, r+u, k+u - mu ruku), these three stand for Icha Shakti, Kriya Shakti and Gnana Shakti.</li>
<h2> Other Names for Murugan:</h2>

<li>Swaminathan - He was the Guru who preached the Pranava Mantra to his father.</li>
<li>Visakhaan - Murugan was born in Visakha Nakshatra hence the name Visakhaan.</li>
<h2>Reason For Some Names Of Murugan:</h2>

<h2>Wisdom Fruit🥭</h2>
<li>One day Narada gave the fruit of wisdom to Shiva and Parvati . </li>
<li>Lord Shiva challenged him to circumambulate the world three times to get it.</li>
<li>Murugan went around the world in his peacock vehicle. </li>
<li>But Ganesha, due to his wisdom, considered his parents to be the world and went around them thrice and obtained the fruit of wisdom. </li>
<li>This is the reason why Murugan is worshiped so much in South India. </li>
<li> A happy Murugan stayed in Tamil Nadu and this is the reason why Murugan is worshiped more in South India.</li> <br>

        infoText = '<h2>Palani(பழனி):</h2> <img src="palani.jpg" height="170" width="450" style="margin-left: 230px;"><br> <br> Palani is a sacred town and one of the Six Abodes of Lord Murugan.Palani Temple History can easily go past several thousand years. Palani is the most famous and prominant place among Murugan’s six houses.Though Palani Malai Temple is most known among the people, thiruavinankudi palani andavar kovil (Temple) is originally the one of the Padai Veedu (House of Murugan). Thiruavinankudi is located near Patha Vinayakar Kovil and we can see most of the people who live in Palani will visit Thiruavinankudi instead of visiting the Malai Kovil (Mountain Temple).Palani Panchamirtham and Thinai Maavu are the most famous eateries of Palanimurugan temple. Among many spiritual legends about Palani two of them are very popular,<br>1) Idumban placed the hill here and unable to take it back because of Murugan’s presence in the hill. Till today Idumban is considered as god and there is a small mountain temple built for Idumban near Palani Murugan temple.<br> <br> <img src="idumban.jpg" width="230" height="210" style="margin-left: 300px;"> <br> <br> 2) This could be the most heard legend in TamilNadu, when Vinayakar came around Sivan and Parvathi to get the divine fruit Murugan went around the world as the competition is, come around the world. Vinayakar justified his act saying Siva and Parvathi were the world for him. So the divine fruit was given to Vinayakar, frustrated by this Murugan travelled in anger and stood on today’s Palani temple <br> <br> <img src="wisdom fruit vinayagar.webp" height="200" width="300" style="margin-left: 270px;"> <br> <br> The most interesting part of Palani Temple History is the navabashanam statue of Murugan that was made by Bogar several thousand years ago. The medicinal value of Navabashanam statue is, it can cure any disease with a pinch of it. Murugan’s navabashanam statue was made of nine poisonous materials which are mixed together at a very right proportion. Only the highly talented alchemist can do this. If the substances are mixed with wrong proportion then the substances will evaporate. So the making of Navabashanam statue was still a out standing question. Bogar established temple for Murugan in two places, Palani and Katirgamam (Eelam) <br><br><img src="bogar with statue.jpg"height="150" width="200" style="margin-left: 120px;"><img src="bogar with statue kovil.jpg" width="450"height="150"> <br>There were many tests taken to know the chemical property of Navabashanam statue but surprisingly the PH value is neutral and it is neither acidic or basic. So Bogar is considered to be the most advanced alchemist better than any other chemist till today.<br> Still people believe two more Navabashanam statues which are hidden by Bogar is still staying under ground around the areas of Palani. Recently archeologist excavated Tamil Brahmi scripts, pots around Palani which are several thousand years oldOn top of Palani Malai Kovil(Mountain temple) in Bogar Sannadhi they still have the Maragadha lingam which is said to be worshipped by Bogar.They also have materials saying those used by Bogar and it is showcased to all.

At this place, he performed the dance to Auvaiyar who was on his way to Madurai.Arrogance arose that he was the one who reached the top of fame due to his knowledge. Murugan, who wanted to free her from that ego, appeared as a boy herding goats while she was walking through the forest to Madurai. He sat on a branch of a novel tree there. Avvai came and sat under the tree due to the fatigue of walking. He was tired because of the long journey. It made the stomach hungry.<br>Then, by chance, he saw a shepherd boy sitting on that tree branch. He also saw that there were many novel fruits on that tree. He immediately said to the boy, "Child... I am hungry. Can you pick some novel fruits?" he asked. To that, Lord Muruga, who was a boy, asked, "Do you want baked fruit? Do you want unbaked fruit?"<br><br><center><img src="Pazhamudhircholai history.jpg" height="180" width="350"><h3>Hundreds of bats in some trees near Palamudir Oasis</h3></center><br>Avva did not understand the boys question. Is there such a thing as baked fruit and unbaked fruit? Thinking that, he jokingly asked, "Would you like to give me the unripe fruit...". "Do you want unripe fruit? OK, I will shake it. Look for the unripe fruit and take it." When Lord Muruga plucked a branch of the novel tree, the novel fruits fell down from it. Avai picked the fruit and blew it with her mouth to remove the sand stuck to the fruit. Lord Muruga, the little boy, was watching this and asked, "What grandmother... is the fruit ripe?" he asked.<br>At that one question from the boy, Avvais pride flew away. Avvai predicted that the boy who made her think could not be human, asked, "Child... who are you?" Lord Muruga, who jumped down from the tree branch, blessed him by showing his self-image.<br>The branch of the novel tree where this play took place is still visible at the top of Cholaimalai.
